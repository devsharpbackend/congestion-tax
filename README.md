# congestion-tax
The purpose of this project is calculating congestion tax fees for vehicles within a specific city that has its own business rules.
This project is based on DDD  and CQRS architectural patterns.
In this project, efforts have been made to adhere to SOLID principles and to follow separation of concerns  in all layers based on their respective responsibilities.
In the Doamin layer, using Aggregate Pattern, we separated the domains, and each of them has its own Object Service for data management and its dependent entities. Also, a separate Repository is designed for each Aggregate.
